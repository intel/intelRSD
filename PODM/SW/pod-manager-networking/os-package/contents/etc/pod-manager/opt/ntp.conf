# Use servers from the NTP Pool Project. Approved by Ubuntu Technical Board
# on 2011-02-08 (LP: #104525). See http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html for
# more information.
# Uncomment these records if PODM has the access to worldwide network or add new ones if needed.

# If none of above servers are available, PODM will use itself as a NTP server.
# This might happen if PODM has no access to worldwide network or there is a temporary connectivity problem.
