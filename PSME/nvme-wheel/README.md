**Note**: The NVMe Initiator Wheel script, `nvme-wheel`, was developed and tested on Ubuntu\* version 16.04 with Python\* version 2.7.14.

## Overview
An initiator host polls the Discovery Service to ensure that its connections to remote volumes are up-to-date. And the NVMe Intiator Wheel script, `nvme-wheel`, is a tool that performs these actions.

This ReadMe describes the operation of the NVMe Intiator Wheel, which is installed on an initiator host. The tool can be a cron job script that wraps up the `nvme-cli` utility.

## Installation of the NVMe Initiator Wheel

**Note**: Installation of `nvme-wheel` requires `nvme-cli`. Instructions for how to download and install `nvme-cli` are available at: https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli. For more information refer to http://nvmexpress.org. The package 'nvme-cli' is available as part of the source for 16.04 in the Ubuntu repository. As root:

'apt-get install nvme-cli'


### Dependencies
Installation of `nvme-wheel` requires a wheel module linked with Python2\*.

**Note**: Wheel is a packaging format for Python and meant to replace the Egg format. To learn more about Wheel, go to https://pythonwheels.com/.

1. To install Python\* and Pip Installs Packages (PIP):
```bash
[sudo] apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
```

[Alternative] If the previous step does not set a PIP, use an easy install:
```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```

2. To install the wheel module:
```bash
pip install wheel
```

3. To install the `nvme-wheel`:
```bash
[sudo] bash INSTALL.sh
```

or

```bash
[sudo] -H pip install NVME_Wheel*
```

**Note**: "Wheel" is a module that allows users to install .whl packages. And `nvme-wheel` is the name of the script that we run in the terminal window.

## Running `nvme-wheel`
To show available commands, type:

```bash
nvme-wheel
```

To run in continuous mode, use the `execute` command:

```bash
nvme-wheel execute
```

For more information about custom arguments, run:

```bash
nvme-wheel execute --help
```

### Run `nvme-wheel` with Example Parameters
Below is an example of running the `nvme-wheel` command with example parameters:

```bash
nvme-wheel execute -t rdma -a 10.6.0.101 -s 4420
```

If you use an NVMe Qualified Name (NQN) different than your system Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), type:
```bash
nvme-wheel execute -t rdma -a 10.6.0.101 -s 4420 -q custom_id_for_nqn
```

### Run `nvme-wheel` in the Background
To run in continuous mode and in the background, you can use `nohup`:

```bash
nohup nvme-wheel execute <<additional_args>> &
```

If `nohup` isn't available on your machine, try:

```bash
nvme-wheel execute <<additional_args>> &
```

### Run `nvme-wheel` in cron table
Run the script automatically after a reboot by adding this line below, into crontab (cron table):

In terminal type `crontab -e` to open a crontab and type:

```bash
@reboot sudo -H nvme-wheel execute -t rdma -a 10.6.0.101 -s 4420 -q << custom_id_for_nqn >>
```

### Get the UUID
To print the UUID, use:

```bash
nvme-wheel uuid
```

### Change the Default Discovery Time
The `nvme-wheel` discovers a new target every five seconds. This default value can be changed by exporting a `NVME_CRON`
(for example, change the default discovery time from five to 10 seconds):

```bash
NVME_CRON=10
```

### Check the Status
`nvme-wheel` has the ability to present status information for a specific endpoint: `localhost:8082/health`

Run the application using the `nvme-wheel execute` command and add an `-e/--endpoint` parameter at the end.

The default option provides health status as a response:

The program will return code `204` if everything works and code `503` if the script stops working (in debug mode program always return `200`).

In `DEBUG` mode you can expand this information with the following:

| Item | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `status` | Serves an `Ok` or `Error` when the `nvme-wheel` has stopped working. |
| `last-timestamp` | The timestamp of the last request to the discovery target. |
| `cron-value` | The time (in seconds) between each discovery iteration. |
| `number-of-targets` | The number of targets connected to the initiator. |
| `connected-targets` | The detailed information about connected targets (name, port, address and status). |


#### Change the Default Port
Export:
```bash
NVME_PORT=port-number
```

#### Change the Default Mode
Export:
```bash
NVME_MODE=DEBUG
```
To set the `PRODUCTION` mode, unset `NVME_MODE`.
